** Everything in Python is Object **
** Every object contains methods **

aval=10
bval  = 34.4



string

aname = 'python'
bname = "scala programming"
cname = """java programming"""
dname = '''unix shell'''












list
-----
list contains set of elements.

In dictionary... keys are always unique
               value can be number,string,list,tuple or complex data structure
***** Indexing is NOT allowed in the dictionary and set *****

syntax:    object = {key:value , key:value , key:value }
example:     book = {"chap1":10,"chap2":20,"chap3":30,"chap1":100}

book = {"chap1":[10,'Rao','IND'],"chap2":[20,'Rita','US']}
